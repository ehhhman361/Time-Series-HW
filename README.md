 In this notebook I read the csv on futures contract on the Yen-dollar exchange rate from it's csv file into a Dataframe. After I trimmed the data set to begin on 1-1-1990. Plotted the 'Settle' column data from the dataframe. The graph shows patterns in the 10 year intervals, while showing initial growth over time. After I imported the HP filter to filter the noise and the trend of the same 'Settle' data. Later created a new dataframe composed of the 'Settle','Settle Noise' and 'Settle Trend' data. I plotted the data over a time period from 2015 to the present date and compared the Settle Trend' to the the 'Settle' data, and plotted the 'Settle Noise'. Nextestmated the Arma Model by cleaning the 'settle' data to show the percentage change over time. The Output shows the model is not a good fit because it exceeds 0.05. I then plotted the 5 day forecast. I then made an arima model and summarized and plotted the results. After that I used GARCH to display the volatility. So based on the time series analysis I would not buy the yen now. The risk has continually increased over time. I would not feel confident for these models to make trade decisions. My conclusion would be the at the out-of-sample predictions performed better in the the In-sample prediction
